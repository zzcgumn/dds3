# Task 14 — Finalize documentation and close the effort

Goal
- Finalize the plan, harness, tests, CI integration, and write up the final report.

Steps
1. Update `copilot/plans/compare_heuristic_sorting.md` with lessons learned and final status.
2. Ensure `copilot/reports/heuristic_equivalence_report.md` is complete with triage notes.
3. Remove any temporary debug artifacts and ensure tests are maintained in the repo.

Verification
- The plan and report are updated and a PR is ready to merge containing all non-controversial changes.

Notes
- Hand off remaining action items (if any) to maintainers with clear next steps.
