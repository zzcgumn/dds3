# Unit Test Trans Table Tasks

This directory contains actionable tasks for implementing comprehensive unit tests for the DDS transposition table classes.

## Task Overview

The tasks are organized in a logical sequence to build a complete test suite:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-3)
- **Task 01**: Create test directory structure
- **Task 02**: Create testable trans table library target
- **Task 03**: Create test utilities and mock data generators

### Phase 2: Basic Testing (Tasks 4-5)
- **Task 04**: Create base class unit tests
- **Task 05**: Create TransTableS basic functionality tests

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (Tasks 6-8)
- **Task 06**: Create TransTableS advanced feature tests
- **Task 07**: Create TransTableL basic functionality tests
- **Task 08**: Create TransTableL advanced feature tests

### Phase 4: Integration and Performance (Tasks 9-10)
- **Task 09**: Create integration tests
- **Task 10**: Create performance and stress tests

### Phase 5: Build and Validation (Tasks 11-12)
- **Task 11**: Create test build configuration
- **Task 12**: Execute and validate initial test suite

### Phase 6: Completion (Tasks 13-14)
- **Task 13**: Comprehensive test implementation and coverage analysis
- **Task 14**: Final integration and documentation

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Sequential Execution**: Tasks should be completed in order as they build upon each other
2. **Verification**: Each task includes verification steps to ensure completion
3. **Dependencies**: Pay attention to task dependencies listed in each file
4. **Quality**: Focus on test quality and comprehensive coverage

## Key Objectives

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: >90% line coverage, >85% branch coverage
- **Robustness**: Test edge cases and error conditions thoroughly  
- **Performance**: Validate performance characteristics and memory usage
- **Integration**: Ensure tests work with existing build system and CI/CD
- **Maintainability**: Create clean, well-documented, maintainable test code

## Test Focus Areas

- **TransTable Base Class**: Virtual interface and inheritance
- **TransTableS**: Small memory implementation with all features
- **TransTableL**: Large memory implementation with advanced features
- **Integration**: Cross-implementation consistency and real game scenarios
- **Performance**: Stress testing and performance validation

## Expected Deliverables

Upon completion, this will provide:
- Complete unit test suite for all trans table classes
- Test utilities and mock data generators
- Performance benchmarks and stress tests
- Integration with build system and CI/CD
- Comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

Begin with Task 01 and work through the tasks sequentially. Each task file contains detailed steps, expected outcomes, and verification criteria.
