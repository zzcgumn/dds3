# Task 06: Extract Remaining `\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic) Functions (Batch 1)

## Objective
Extract the next set of ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)*` functions from `moves.cpp`: ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Refactor all functions to use `HeuristicContext`
- [ ] Ensure all functions compile without errors
- [ ] Maintain identical algorithmic behavior for all functions
- [ ] Document any shared patterns or utilities discovered

## Implementation Notes
- Apply the same refactoring patterns established in tasks 04-05
- Look for common code that could be factored into utility functions
- Pay attention to any function interdependencies
- Maintain the same function organization and comments

## Dependencies
- Tasks 04-05 should be completed to establish the refactoring pattern
- Any shared utilities or context updates from previous tasks

## Output
- Four fully implemented functions in `heuristic_sorting.cpp`
- Documentation of any new utility functions or context updates needed
- Notes on any shared patterns between these functions
