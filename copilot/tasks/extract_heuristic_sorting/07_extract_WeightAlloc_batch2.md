# Task 07: Extract Remaining `\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic) Functions (Batch 2)

## Objective
Extract the final set of ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)*` functions from `moves.cpp`: ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, and the level 3 functions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Extract ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function
- [ ] Refactor all functions to use `HeuristicContext`
- [ ] Ensure all functions compile without errors
- [ ] Maintain identical algorithmic behavior for all functions

## Implementation Notes
- Complete the migration of all heuristic sorting functions
- The ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)` function may be more complex
- Ensure all function signatures match the declarations in `internal.h`
- Look for any remaining utility functions that need to be extracted

## Dependencies
- Tasks 04-06 should be completed
- All previous refactoring patterns and utilities should be established

## Output
- All remaining ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)*` functions implemented in `heuristic_sorting.cpp`
- Complete migration of heuristic sorting logic from `moves.cpp`
- Documentation of the final function set and any special considerations
