# Task 02: Map public API and call sites

## Objective
Understand how callers use heuristic sorting and the public API shapes.

## Steps
- Enumerate functions and types in `Moves.cpp` (and `Moves.h`) tied to heuristic sorting.
- Enumerate the public API in `library/src/heuristic_sorting`.
- Find and list call sites relying on the legacy path signatures.
- Highlight any mismatches or adapter needs.

## Verification
- A side-by-side API/usage table exists.
- Saved notes at `copilot/reports/remove_legacy_heuristic_sorting/02_api_map.md`.

## Expected outputs
- Table of functions/types with notes on deltas and proposed resolution.
