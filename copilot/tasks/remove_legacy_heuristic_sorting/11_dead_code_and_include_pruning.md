# Task 11: Dead code and include pruning

## Objective
Remove residues from the legacy implementation and tidy includes.

## Steps
- Remove unused helpers/types left from the legacy path.
- Run include organization tools and delete unused includes.
- Re-run build to confirm no missing includes.

## Verification
- Clean build; fewer warnings; leaner diffs in future.

## Expected outputs
- Simplified source files with minimal includes.
