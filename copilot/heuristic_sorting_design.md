When generating remaining cards randomly, note that the remaining ranks should be number continously from ace and downwards. This is an optimisation based on the observation that only relative ranks matter.

5. The Move Ordering algorithm
The weight of a card in the move list is affected by the suit and the rank of the card and by the
other cards in the same trick. The weights of the cards in the move list are used to sort them,
with the cards having the highest weight being sorted first in the list.
If the hand-to-play is the trick-leading hand or is void in the suit played by leading hand, the card
with the highest weight for each present suit will get a high additional bonus weight. After list
resorting, those cards will occupy the first positions in the move list.
Two "best moves" are maintained for each searched depth, one for an alpha-beta cutoff and one
at a Transposition Table entry match. At an alpha-beta cutoff, the move causing the cutoff
overwrites the present "best move" for the current depth. When a Transposition Table entry is
created, the current best move is stored in that entry if:
 The target is met and the leading hand belongs to the player’s side,
 Or the target is not met and the leading hand belongs to the other side.
 Otherwise the best move is not stored in the Transposition Table entry.
At a Transposition Table entry match, its stored best move will be best move for the current
search depth.

By ”card move” in the following pseudo code is meant the card by the hand-to-play that is getting
a weight in the move list. The ”card rank” is a value in the range 2 (deuce) to 14 (Ace).
For the determination of the weight, it is calculated whether or not the current card move wins the
current trick for the side of the hand-to-play, assuming that both sides play optimum cards.
The following pseudo-code contains empirical weights that are used to obtain move orderings
that tend to put optimum move early in the list of moves. These may or may not be the exact
weights and algorithms used in the current DDS version, but they give an idea of the important
factors; the code is significantly more complex. One aim is to move the likely candidates to the
top of the list, and another aim is to have good mixture of moves (i.e. not all cards from the same
suit first) in case the heuristic is not good for a particular set-up.
If the hand-to-play is void in the trick lead suit, the suit selected for the discard gets a bonus:
suitAdd = ((suit length) * 64)/36;
If the suit length is 2, and the hand-to-play has the next highest rank of the suit, the bonus is
reduced by 2.
Hand-to-play is trick-leading hand
The contribution of the suit to the weight is:
suitWeightDelta = suitBonus – ((countLH+countRH) * 32)/15
suitBonus has the initial value 0, changed if conditions below apply:
If it is a trump contract, and the suit is not trump, then there is a suitBonus change of –10 if
 LHO is void and LHO has trump card(s), or
 RHO is void and RHO has trump card(s).
If RHO has either the highest rank of the suit played by hand-to-play or the next highest rank,
then there is a suitBonus change of –18.
If it is a trump contract, the suit is not trump, the own hand has a singleton, the own hand has at
least one trump, partner has the highest rank in the suit and at least a suit length of 2, then there is
a suitBonus change of +16. Suits are thus favoured where the opponents have as few move
alternatives as possible.
countLH = (suit length of LHO) * 4, if LHO is not void in the suit,
countLH = (depth + 4), if LHO is void in the suit
countRH = (suit length of RHO) * 4, if RHO is not void in the suit,
countRH = (depth + 4), if RHO is void in the suit
