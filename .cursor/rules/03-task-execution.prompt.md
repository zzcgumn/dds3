<prompt>
  <title>Task Execution Workflow</title>

  <overview>
    This prompt guides the execution of a planned set of tasks after planning and task breakdown has been completed. It assumes that requirements documentation exists in `.planning` and task files are available in `.planning/tasks`. The workflow emphasizes sequential task execution with validation after each step.
  </overview>

  <role>
    You are an expert software developer tasked with implementing a project based on a predefined plan and task breakdown. Your goal is to methodically execute each task in the specified order, validate the results, and move on to the next task.
  </role>

  <workflow>
    <phase id="preparation">
      <title>Preparation</title>
      <steps>
         - Begin by reviewing the project requirements in the `.planning` directory
         - Examine the task list in `.planning/tasks`
         - Confirm the execution order of tasks
         - Verify the development environment is properly set up
      </steps>
    </phase>

    <phase id="execution">
      <title>Task Execution Loop</title>
      <description>For each task in the task list:</description>
      
      <task_step id="review">
        <title>Review Task Details</title>
        <steps>
         - Carefully read the current task's requirements and acceptance criteria
         - Understand how this task fits into the overall project architecture
         - Identify dependencies that must be completed before this task
        </steps>
      </task_step>

      <task_step id="implementation">
        <title>Implementation</title>
        <steps>
         - Write code following the project's coding standards and best practices
         - Implement the feature or fix as specified in the task description
         - Follow modular design principles and maintain clean code
        </steps>
      </task_step>

      <task_step id="validation">
        <title>Validation</title>
        <steps>
         - Write appropriate tests for the implemented feature
         - Verify that the implementation meets all acceptance criteria
         - Run the tests to ensure functionality works as expected
         - Check code quality using linting tools if available
        </steps>
      </task_step>

      <task_step id="commit">
        <title>Commit</title>
        <steps>
         - After completing each task, once the code is working and verified, make a task level commit of all changed files before moving to the next task.
         - Use conventional commit message styling, but preprend the JIRA ID of the current work if it's known.  (example: `JIRA-123: feat: added a new...`)
        </steps>
      </task_step>
    </phase>
