- [x] Add/verify Doxygen-style documentation for top-level functions in `src` (as found in `include` headers)
- [x] Add/verify Doxygen-style documentation for other relevant files in `src`
  - [x] Continue methodically documenting remaining .cpp files (e.g., DealerPar.cpp, Par.cpp, etc.)
  - [x] Continue with next .cpp files (e.g., PlayAnalyser.cpp, LaterTricks.cpp, etc.)
  - [x] Continue with next .cpp files (e.g., QuickTricks.cpp, TransTableL.cpp, etc.)
  - [x] Continue with next .cpp files (e.g., TransTableS.cpp, etc.)
  - [x] Continue with next .cpp files (e.g., Scheduler.cpp, Scheduler.h, etc.)
  - [x] Continue with next .cpp files (e.g., ThreadMgr.cpp, ThreadMgr.h, etc.)
  - [x] Continue with next .cpp files (e.g., System.cpp, System.h, etc.)
- [x] Migrate Bazel build system to Bzlmod (MODULE.bazel) and verify build completes successfully with Bazel 8+
- [x] Add and verify Bazel Doxygen documentation build target (`doxygen_docs`)
