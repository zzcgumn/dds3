## Task 4: Easier-to-read Implementation (Phase 1 Parity)

- **Goal:** Implement the `score_and_order` function, porting the rules from `doc/heuristic-sorting.md`.
- **Key Actions:**
    - Create the implementation file `library/src/heuristic_sorting/heuristic_sorting.cpp`.
    - Translate the logic from the existing `Moves.cpp` into smaller, well-named functions.
    - Ensure the new implementation is a 1:1 mapping of the existing logic to achieve parity.
- **Deliverable:** A C++ source file with the implementation of the `score_and_order` function.
