## Task 2: Library API Design

- **Goal:** Create the public API for the new `heuristic_sorting` library.
- **Key Actions:**
    - Define public types (`HeuristicContext`, `CandidateMove`, `ScoredMove`, etc.) in a new header file.
    - Define the public function signature for `score_and_order`.
    - Ensure the design is pure, side-effect-free, and deterministic.
- **Deliverable:** A new header file `library/src/heuristic_sorting/heuristic_sorting.h` with the API definition.
