## Task 1: Discovery and Boundaries

- **Goal:** Inventory functions and data used by the current heuristic in `library/src/Moves.cpp`.
- **Key Actions:**
    - Identify all functions related to move ordering (e.g., ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, ``\0` (migrated into library/src/heuristic_sorting; canonical API: CallHeuristic)`, `MergeSort`).
    - List all data structures used (`moveType`, `pos`, `trackType`, etc.).
    - Define the minimal data interface required for the new library.
- **Deliverable:** A document summarizing the findings.
